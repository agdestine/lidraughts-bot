-> Proof that this algorithm is correct: 3/3
Feedback : Excellent ! Consider explaining that the property hold also at the termination (at the end of the loop).

-> Linear-time algorithm for this task: 2/2
Feedback : Perfect !!!

-> Justification for its correctness: 2/2
Feedback : Perfect !!!

-> Overall time in terms of |E|? 2.5/3
Feedback : Good work. But you omit to express the time in terms on |E| as specified in the question.

OVERALL FEEDBACK:
Excellent and legible work !!!

Feedback : Good ! But, not clear what algorithm will be used to detect the existence of cycle given an edge.
